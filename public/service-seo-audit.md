# Technical SEO Site Checkup

Welcome to my Technical SEO Site Checkup service! With my decade long expertise in digital marketing, I'm here to help you improve your website's ranking on major search engines. I use cutting-edge audit tools to analyze your website and highlight all the critical issues that need to be fixed.
For just **Â£75.00** (for a website of not more then 20 pages), I can schedule your site checkup within the next 5 working days. The process usually takes a couple of hours and covers a range of factors that affect your site's SEO performance. My report will provide feedback on the following areas:

- Back-end factors such as hosting and indexing
- Front-end factors such as content, keywords, and metadata
- Link quality and outside references

I am so confident in my service that I offer a **15-day full refund** policy, no questions asked. If you're not satisfied with the results, you can get your money back without any hassle.
